## Overview of Project

The PyCity Schools challenge presented us with two objectives: 1) identify and replace the inaccurate math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School using the Pandas loc method. Thereafer, we use the Pandas NumPy module to change those reading and math scores to NaN. 2) Repeat the School District Analysis we did in module 4. This process included 15 steps to recreate the following metrics:

    1. The district summary
    2. The school summary
    3. The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    4. The average math score for each grade level from each school
    5. The average reading score for each grade level from each school
    6. The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
    
## Results

In reviewing the original key performance indicators and the updated performace data, much of it remained the same. Provided this was such a large data set, updating data for only 1 out of the 15 schools didn't have a substantial impact. The initial dataframe for all 15 schools is below:
