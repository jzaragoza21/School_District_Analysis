## Overview of Analysis

The PyCity Schools challenge presented us with two objectives: 1) identify and replace the inaccurate math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School using the Pandas loc method. Thereafer, we use the Pandas NumPy module to change those reading and math scores to NaN. 2) Repeat the School District Analysis we did in module 4. This process included 15 steps to recreate the following metrics:

    1. The district summary
    2. The school summary
    3. The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    4. The average math score for each grade level from each school
    5. The average reading score for each grade level from each school
    6. The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type
